step 1 -> start nmap scann 
           
          Syntax : nmap -sV -A -O IP ADDRESS 

step 2 -> check if http or https is running 

step 3 -> found ssh and http running 

step 4 -> using gobuster to find the hidden directories 

step 5 -> found an hidden page /content/ 
       
          got some details and telling about to turn on the website , if we are a webmaster it give's us a idea that we need to have page where we can operate the whole webpage settings

step 6 -> using gobuster to find the hidden pages inside /content/

          found /as/    and    /inc/

step 7 -> found a a mysql_bacup file in /inc/ folder 

          inside the mysql_backup file found username and password 
 
          password was encrypted but we can decrypt it online 
 
          username = manager & password = Password123 

step 8 -> using the credentials we logged in the website and turned the website on 

          after exploring found an functionaltiy "ads" which helps to put up our code so we can put our php reverse shell 

step 9 -> setting up our netcat listener 

          go to http://IP ADDRESS/inc/ads     run the reverse shell 

step 10 -> stabilizing the shell using 
           -->python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
           -->export TERM=xterm

step 11 -> found the user.txt 

step 12 -> now privilige escalation , type sudo -l

step 13 -> we can run sudo commands for /home/itguy/backup.pl

step 14 -> using cat command toin backup.pl  found a system command calling /etc/copy.sh

step 15 -> using cat command to view the contents of copy.sh , found a reverse shell ,
          
           so we can change the ip and port to our ip address and port 
step 16 -> setting up netcat listener on different port 

step 17 -> run the command sudo /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.perl
