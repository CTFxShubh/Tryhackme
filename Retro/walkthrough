**First and foremost trying nmap to scann for the open ports and exposed Services

	--> Found 2 open ports running 
		-> 80 : Internet Information Services
		-> 3389 : Microsfot RDP services 

	80 : Doing a quick research from CHAT GPT , I found out the IIS is an service by micrsoft which is used to host website on the WINDOWS machine 

	3389 : is an RDP like service which is used to control the machine remotly , but it requires username and password



** Second thing using gobuster 

	--> Found 2 hidden directory 
		-> /retro  , /Retro 
		Looking those directory , I found out new website 

	--> Using Goubster again to bruteforce the directory inside the /retro
		-> found wordpress common directory , so from there I found out that Wordpress is begin used 

		Looking around the website found the login page 
			-> /retro/wp-login.php

** Credentials 
	
	--> Using WPScan to enumerate users
		->  Found user = wade 

	--> Entering the wade user with a random password teels us in the login page that password for user wade is incorrect which confirms about the wade user

	--> While there were so many chats or something like that in the website , I found a chat in which wade used to forget his password 

		-> And in another chat he left behind an note in which  "parzival"  was written



** Initial Access 

	--> After getting the initial access , the first thing to get a shell is test for Theme Editor 404 , which is basically pasting an php reverse shell and just invoking it

		-> It failed because it gets automatically disconnected 

	--> Trying Malicious Plugin 
		-> It failed too

	
	After failing , next thing was to do iss to gett the rdp access and the only credential's we have is wade and his password 


	--> Using those credentials with xfreerdp tool we goot an GUI Initial Access

** Privilege Escalation

	--> They gave hint which I was not able to understand and after searching around for a while , I found out that there is an Kernel Exploit for this version

	--> Using the Kernel Exploit to get Administrative shell
