1. start scanning using nmap 

2. found three ports
   ftp -> 21
   ssh -> 22
   http -> 80 

3. seems like http is running , opened in fire fox 
   viewing the source page it tell to add team.thm on host directory 

   /etc/hosts is directory where our computer store the address of a particular website 
   so to access the team.thm we will add it in out /etc/hosts directory 

   SYNTAX : <IP ADDRESS> team.thm

4. seems like a normal wesite ,started dobuster found assests , images , scripts 
   under the scripts it shows a bash file and under that it tell that "script" file is being updated 
   we need to find the old extension 
   
   nano extension.txt , inside this file i wrote script ,so we will use it has a wordlist
   
   now gobuster dir -u http://team.thm/scripts -w ~/extension.txt -x php,txt,old
   
   after that we found a script.old file 

5. inside the script.old file we found credentials of ftp , using this credentials we 
   logged in 
       
   username : ftpuser
   password : T3@m$h@r3
    
   found a "New_site.txt"  opening the text file it was telling about a new php  website which in currently being built
   to access it we need to add dev as our domain inside the /etc/hosts , so 
   
   from above while adding the team.thm we will put some space and add dev.team.thm
 
   SYNTAX : dev.team.thm
   
6. After opening the dev.team.thm 
   In the link i found a parameter page=
   so entering /etc/ssh/sshd_config in the above parameter 
   
   Because it contains private_rsa key for dale 

   NOTE : sshd_config does not contain it private_rsa_key but from "New_site.txt" it was giving a hint to view this file 

   Found private_rsa key but everything is messed up now in view page source you will find it copying it  
   and giving ti only read permission to it 

7. logging in it as dale
   ssh -i id_rsa dale@team.thm

8. typing sudo -l 
   we can see that we can run "admin_checks" but as gyle user 
   syntax sudo -u gyle ./admin_checks
9. entering some random values
   we got gyle sheel 

10. stabilizing the shell using python 

11. now we can see that there a file in /opt/admin_stuff/script.sh
    inside this scipr_sh we can see that this file is telling that root is running this file every minute 

12. so editing the file into a netcat reverse shell and setting up a listener on our machine 

13. we got our root shell 


    NOTE : read the source page carefully and understand the clue and try different ways to enumerate it
