1. Using nmap scan the sevices on the IP

   Found 2 ports open 80 , 22

2. Using gobuster to enumerate the directories 

   A Lot result were found but nothing was interesting accept the /admin page

3. Since nothing we can do further , we can only do is [ SUBDOMAIN ENUMERATION ]

   using wfuzz to enumerate the subdomain

   SYNTAX : wfuzz -u 'website url' -c -f < output file name > -H "HOST : FUZZ.< website url > -hw 290

   -u = url 
   -w = subdomain wordlist
   -c = colour output
   -f = output file name , output to be saved 
   -H = HEADER , tell the wfuzz where to apply the words from the list in URL
   -hw = to hide response based on the word size 
     
4. Now based on the output found an subdomain dev , visiting dev.cmess.thm
   
   Found some chat's of user's and got credentials 

   email : andre@cmess.thm
   pass  : KPFTN_f2yxe%

5. Loged to the website found the Gila CMS version 1.10.9
   
   Searching for the exploits in the searchsploit found LFI 
  
   http://10.10.190.67/admin/fm/?f=src../../../../../../../../../WINDOWS/system32/drivers/etc/hosts

6. uploading php reverse shell 

7. now once the file is being uploaded we need to execute the file on the server by calling the file 

8. setting up the listner on the attacker machine 

9. so to do this URL is http://cmess.thm/php-reverse-shell.php

10. we will get the shell 

11. after getting reverse shell we need to search for some files for the username or password or any vulnerable thing 

12. found .password.bak file inside /opt directory it was hidden file 

13. found ceredentials for andre , now loged in andre using ssh 

    username : andre
    pass     : UQfsdCB7aAP6

14. So there was a directory inside the backup file 
    
    every 2 min backup was being created using tar and when we checked inside the crontab we found wildcard 

    so gaining access using wild card extension
