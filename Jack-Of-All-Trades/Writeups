** Using nmap to find the open ports 

 --> Found 2 open ports 
     There is twist in here 

     Port service
     
  1. 22    http
     
  2. 80    ssh

we were not able to access the port 22 because it was restricted so we need to enable to browser to access the port 22 because http was running there 

type about:config --> then type "network.security.ports.banned.override" --> then type the value 22 

Now it will allow the access 



** Found an user named * jack *
   --> Reviewing the source code found and directory /recovery.php 
       and an encoded string  

       " UmVtZW1iZXIgdG8gd2lzaCBKb2hueSBHcmF2ZXMgd2VsbCB3aXRoIGhpcyBjcnlwdG8gam9iaHVudGluZyEgSGlzIGVuY29kaW5nIHN5c3RlbXMgYXJlIGFtYXppbmchIEFsc28gZ290dGEgcmVtZW1iZXIgeW91ciBwYXNzd29yZDogdT9XdEtTcmFxCg== "

  --> Decoding the above base64 encoded string it gives a simple message 

      " Remember to wish Johny Graves well with his crypto jobhunting! His encoding systems are amazing! Also gotta remember your password: u?WtKSraq "

      From Johny Graves , I dont have any clue , so after googling it I found a webpage in which John Graves posted this 

        --> " My Favourite Crypto Method:First encode your message with a ROT13 cipher. Next Convert it to Hex. Finally convert the result into Base32.It's uncrackable! "

    

Visiting the recovery.php found an encoded string 
  --> " GQ2TOMRXME3TEN3BGZTDOMRWGUZDANRXG42TMZJWG4ZDANRXG42TOMRSGA3TANRVG4ZDOMJXGI3DCNRXG43DMZJXHE3DMMRQGY3TMMRSGA3DONZVG4ZDEMBWGU3TENZQGYZDMOJXGI3DKNTDGIYDOOJWGI3TINZWGYYTEMBWMU3DKNZSGIYDONJXGY3TCNZRG4ZDMMJSGA3DENRRGIYDMNZXGU3TEMRQG42TMMRXME3TENRTGZSTONBXGIZDCMRQGU3DEMBXHA3DCNRSGZQTEMBXGU3DENTBGIYDOMZWGI3DKNZUG4ZDMNZXGM3DQNZZGIYDMYZWGI3DQMRQGZSTMNJXGIZGGMRQGY3DMMRSGA3TKNZSGY2TOMRSG43DMMRQGZSTEMBXGU3TMNRRGY3TGYJSGA3GMNZWGY3TEZJXHE3GGMTGGMZDINZWHE2GGNBUGMZDINQ= "

  First I thought that Its base 64 but its output is very wierd so , then I remember Johny Graves tweet using cyberchef 

   --> from Base32 -> fomr Hex -> from ROT13 

   It will give the output

   " Remember that the credentials to the recovery login are hidden on the homepage! I know how forgetful you are, so here's a hint: bit.ly/2TvYQ2S "


Visiting the page is Steganosoraus , now I tthougt we need to do steganography so I did for image of dianasorus and jacinthebox but it didnt work so I went to /assets/headers.jpg 

 Doing --> steghide -sf extract <image name>
           to extract the content with password u?WtKSraq

Found cms login credentials , inside that it was asking about cmd parameter and , inside parameteer , we can put values 

using the parameter found an jacks_password_list , so using hydra to bruteforce the ssh of jack found password
