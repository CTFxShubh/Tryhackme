1.  Nmap to find the ports and services 
    found ssh,ftp,and a webserver 

2.  we need to redirect to secret login page 
    so we will use curl 
    SYNTAX : curl -A "C" -L "http://10.10.113.179" > curl.txt

             -A allows us to send user agent to server 
             -L follows the redirection 


    found that charles as a weal password so bruteforcing ftp to find the password

3.  hydra -l chris -P ~/Tryhackme/List_For_Enumeration/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.113.179 ftp -s 21 -V -f

    Found the password:
    [21][ftp] host: 10.10.113.179   login: chris   password: crystal

4.  login in ftp using the above credentials 
    found 1 txt file and 2 images 

5. using binwalk <image name>  to see any hidden image inside the file 

   found a hidden zipfile inside the image 
   
   SYNTAX : binwalk -e <image name> it will automatically extract the know file type 

6. there is text by from agent j which tell the password for the next image but the password is encoded 
   using cyberchef website to decode that code 
   Found password Area51 

7. Now using steghid --extract -sf <image name>
   it will ask for password : Area51 
   found a "message.txt" file in which it tells about the ssh login credentials about james

8. using above credentails we will login using ssh 

9. now privilege escalation 
   typing sudo -l 
   it shows : (ALL, !root) /bin/bash
   which means the user james cannot run /bin/bash as root 
   


   searching for the exploits found one CVE-2019-14287
   a python3 code , creating a python3 file and giving it exectuing permission 

10. we got the root account
