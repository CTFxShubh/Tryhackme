Step 1 : Scan the IP Address given by tryhackme 
         2 ports were open 
         1st Service = ssh
         2nd Service = http

Step 2 : If a http service is running check the IP address in web browser 

Step 3 : Find the hidden directories in the website using gobuster 
    
         syntax = gobuster dir -u http://10.10.22.134 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt > gobuster.txt

         found a admin page in admin page the inspect tool revealed a user name called john and admin 

Step 4 : checking whether the request of the username and password is sent in GET or POST and in the inspect tool under the network tab it was found that the username and password were
       
         in post form 

Step 5 : Hydra to brute force the admin page 


         Syntax= hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.22.134  http-form-post "/admin/index.php:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:F=Username or password invalid" > hydra.txt 

Step 6 : Found RSA key now to decrypt it with john 

         /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py RSA.key > new.key

         Now its ready to decrypt using john to find john user passphrase

         john new.key --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Step 7 : using SSH to login john using RSA KEY before login give execution permission to RSA key chmod +x RSA KEY

         syntax = ssh -i RSA KEY john@IP ADDRESS 

         now it will ask for the passphrase just enter it 

Step 8 : Privilege to root

         now in Linux there is a file path /etc/shadow in shadow it contains all the password of user copy all the user password into a new file and crack it again using john 
         
         you will find the password of root login the password in root typing su and enter it and enter the password
